# Receipts
Receipts database tools for Android.
<br/>
<br/>
The need behind this project is to design a tool to record receipts and further statistics in order to maintain a household budget.
This is also my attempt to have fun with Android Studio and an excuse to use AI elements. 
The project is under construction. It currently contains the following modules:
- OCR using https://github.com/CanHub/Android-Image-Cropper and https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition
- receipt editor with Drag & Drop based on JSON files
- SQLite database

An AI-based tagging module is in preparation.
